Health Care Premium Prediction

This project implements a machine learning regression model to predict health insurance premiums based on individual features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and more. The objective is to estimate the expected insurance cost for an individual using a sample/synthetic dataset.

Features

Input Variables: Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, Marital Status, and other relevant health and demographic features.

Model: Regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost) to predict insurance premiums.

Data Handling: Includes preprocessing steps like encoding categorical variables, scaling, and handling missing values.

Evaluation Metrics: Model performance measured using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
