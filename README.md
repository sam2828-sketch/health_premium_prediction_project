Health Care Premium Prediction

This project is a machine learning regression model that predicts health insurance premiums based on individual features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and more. The goal is to provide an estimate of the expected insurance cost for an individual using real-world data.

Features

Input Variables: Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, Marital Status, and other relevant health and demographic features.

Model: Regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) to predict insurance premiums.

Data Handling: Includes preprocessing steps like encoding categorical variables, scaling, and handling missing values.

Evaluation Metrics: Model performance measured using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
